Why does and who restarts the container on failed healthcheck tests. Our container is restarting and we don't like it. 

## Improvements could be made to Device for custom healthchecks

1. Able to store and view past healthchecks
2. Verbose logging needed for custom service healthchecks
3. Healthcheck parameters being added to docker-compose are being respected.
4. Able to run on their own without pressing `Run Checks` button according to variables set. 
5. More visibility provided for custom healthchecks
